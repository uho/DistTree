To run tests, go to the DistTree root directory
then execute

   python src/disttree.py -DTESTVAR=one -w src/test/demotree.spec

This will do some testing, then stop.

Run

   python src/disttree.py -DTESTVAR=hello -w src/test/demotree.spec

this will create a distribution directory tmp/disttree and
will copy files there, as specified in demotree.spec

You can add the -n option for a dry run.
You can add the -v option to see more output.

You can inspect the resulting distribution tree.

Currently there is no automatic testing, sorry.
